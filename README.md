I have built To-do-list using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
The main function of this project is to add the things that are supposed to be completed in to do list and once the user completes those things he can put in 
completed list. 

Todo:
Gym
Reading
Assignment 

Completed:
Workout

The main use of this project is to keep the schedule updated as in busy life it is hard to remember the things, this to-do-list is best way to keep the things on
schedule and also we will not forget our important tasks.
